This model has 3 different actions applied to potentially two different topographical representations of display information: move-to-nearest, highest, or farthest peak associated with uncertainty and/or salience:
  highest-salience
  nearest-salience
  farthest-salience
  highest-uncertainty
  nearest-uncertainty
  farthest-uncertainty

Or, the model can randomly select between these actions, or randomly select an [x,y] location regardless of the 6 above. 

To have the model randomly select between the highest, nearest, and farthest given a topographical map,
set the paramaters in the helpers.py file so that actions are equally likely to be selected in selectAction():
    zero = 17 	#highest uncertainty
    one = 16  	#nearest uncertainty
    two = 17  	#farthest uncertainty
    three = 16	#highest salience
    four = 17	#nearest salience
    five = 17	#farthest salience

and then call:  
#         app      filename    type    outputfile              blocks   
# to run: python DR-MC_Model.py 1 /home/chris/Desktop/SimData.xls 2

If you change the type from 1 to 0, then the model will randomly select [x,y] regarless of the actions on topographical maps (i.e., truly random).
